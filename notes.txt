Learning AngularJS

Components
    - every angular app has at least one component that we call the Root Component
    - a component can contain other components as well.
    - this helps us manage our view into more reusable parts.
    - A component is a typescript class:
        it can have properties and methods that hold the data for the view
        - properies hold data
        - methods perform the actions
    - components are not attached to the DOM. 
        - we use bindings and bind to the properties and methods of our views
        - we never need a reference to a dom element in order to update it
        - ie: we can do onClick() calls that are decoupled from the dom (this makes it very easy to unit test)
    
Services
    - a class that does anything 

Router
    - decides what component to present to the user

Directive
    - we use directives to modify DOM elements and or extend their behaviour.
    - we can use a directive to make a text box automatically grow when it recieves focus:
        <input type="text" autoGrow/>
